# COMSW4156-ASD-HW4

Instruction:

You should work together with your pair partner from your team; each pair in the team needs to do this assignment separately and submit separately (only one member of the pair needs to submit). 

Build a toy system using your team's selected programming language, development framework, and other technologies.  Recall that besides a programming language and a corresponding web/mobile application development framework, you will need a static analysis "bug finder" tool, a unit testing tool, a build tool (or package manager or other tool that handles dependencies for languages that do not "build"), a continuous integration tool that plays nicely with your git repository, and a persistent data store (either SQL or NoSQL). 

You can start with some existing program or you can write something new.  It does not have to do much. **It just needs to use your development framework, which means it needs a simple front-end, static analysis and some simple tests.  It should store something persistently and be able to read and update that data again later.**  Post your code, build scripts, test cases, etc. in a git repository.  Extra credit will be added if you use continuous integration to automate build (or equivalent), pre-commit and/or post-commit. 

**Submit a single file, 1-2 pages, that tells us how to access your repository, briefly describes your toy system, and discusses your experience using each part of your team's chosen technology.  Did you run into any challenges Was there anything you wanted to do but couldn't get working? If both pairs in the same team use the same repository, make sure to clarify which is which (and be careful not to break each other!).**

The name of this file should include both your team name and pair unis.  For example, costefficent_tl2606_caz2114_homework4.pdf.  You should submit as soon as possible after you are done, you do not need to wait for the deadline.  If relevant, you can resubmit repeatedly until the deadline.
